    "## Federated Logistic Regression with BKR and XXLLNC Data\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how early-warning analyses can be performed across multiple data environments using federated learning. The objective is to estimate logistic regression models that explain outcomes in debt-signal follow-up processes, without centralising or sharing raw individual-level data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analyses focus on understanding which factors influence contact outcomes after a debt signal, such as demographic characteristics, debt indicators, signal source, and outreach activities. These questions are central to early-warning research and policy evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data and Federated Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "The data used in this notebook is assumed to be distributed across **BKR** and **XXLLNC** data environments. These platforms act as software systems for collecting, storing, and analysing early-warning data, each holding different but complementary variables, such as signal characteristics, dossier information, and contact actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the **vantage6** framework, the logistic regression algorithm is sent to each data environment. Local computations are performed there, and only aggregated model updates are returned. At no point are raw records exchanged or combined across organisations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This setup demonstrates that meaningful statistical analyses for early-warning policy and practice can be executed across organisational boundaries while preserving data separation and governance requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview of the Experiments\n",
    "\n",
    "Two federated logistic regression experiments are conducted, each analysing a different stage of the early-warning follow-up process.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Experiment 1: Contact established (dossier level)**  \n",
    "This experiment analyses whether contact is established at least once for a dossier. The outcome variable is `is_contact_gelegd`, and the unit of analysis is the dossier (case). The model includes demographic indicators, debt characteristics, signal source, and the total number of contact attempts. This experiment captures overall follow-up effectiveness and identifies which dossiers are more likely to result in successful contact.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Experiment 2: Successful contact attempt (contact level)**  \n",
    "This experiment focuses on individual outreach actions. The outcome variable is `is_succesvol`, indicating whether a specific contact attempt was successful. The unit of analysis is the contact attempt. In addition to dossier-level characteristics, the model includes contact-specific predictors such as contact type and attempt order. This experiment explains which outreach actions are most effective once contact attempts have started.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What This Demonstrates\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Methodological feasibility**  \n",
    "  Logistic regression analyses commonly used in early-warning research can be performed without centralising individual-level data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cross-platform collaboration**  \n",
    "  Federated learning enables joint model estimation across BKR and XXLLNC environments, while each platform retains full control over its data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Multi-level analysis**  \n",
    "  The federated approach naturally supports analyses at both the dossier level and the contact-attempt level within the same framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following sections present the two experiments in detail, including their federated execution and results."

    "### Experiment 1 — Federated Analysis of Contact Establishment (Dossier Level)\n",
    "\n",
    "This experiment analyses whether contact is established at least once for a dossier after an early-warning signal is received. The outcome variable, `is_contact_gelegd`, equals 1 if any contact attempt for a dossier was successful, and 0 otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "The unit of analysis is the **dossier (case)**. Each dossier aggregates information about the citizen, the debt signal, and the overall outreach effort, including the total number of contact attempts. The model estimates how dossier-level characteristics influence the probability that contact is established at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis is performed in a **federated learning setting**, where data remains distributed across BKR and XXLLNC environments. Each environment computes local updates of the logistic regression model on its own data, and only aggregated model parameters are shared and combined. No individual-level records are exchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "All categorical variables are represented as **one-hot encoded indicators**, and the model is estimated using federated logistic regression. Results are reported using regression coefficients and odds ratios to support interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This experiment addresses the core question in early-warning follow-up analysis:  \n",
    "**Which dossiers are more likely to result in successful contact?**"
